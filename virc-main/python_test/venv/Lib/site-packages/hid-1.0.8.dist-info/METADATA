# Installing pyhidapi
pyhidapi is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hid/) and can be installed using pip.
```

```

pyhidapi is dependant upon the [hidapi library](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi), which must be installed separately.

vid = 0x046d	# Change it for your device
pid = 0xc534	# Change it for your device

with hid.Device(vid, pid) as h:
	print(f'Device manufacturer: {h.manufacturer}')
	print(f'Product: {h.product}')
	print(f'Serial Number: {h.serial}')
```
