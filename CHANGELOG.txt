VIRC PROJECT - CHANGELOG
===============================================

Version 1.1 - 2025-10-28
========================

CRITICAL FIXES:
---------------
1. Fixed duplicate code in virc_firmware/virc_firmware.ino
   - Removed lines 129-140 which were exact duplicates of lines 117-128
   - This was causing compilation errors
   - Firmware now compiles successfully

2. Fixed USB VID mismatch in complete_gui.py
   - Changed from Adafruit VID (0x239a) to Raspberry Pi VID (0x2e8a)
   - Added fallback support for both VIDs
   - Auto-detects which VID the device is using
   - Improved device detection and compatibility

IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------
3. Enhanced complete_gui.py device enumeration
   - Now shows both VID and PID in device list
   - Better error messages when device not found
   - Automatic fallback to Adafruit VID if needed

4. Updated requirements.txt
   - Added comments explaining each package
   - Specified minimum versions
   - Added note about PyInstaller for deployment

NEW DOCUMENTATION:
------------------
5. Created FIRMWARE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.txt
   - Complete step-by-step Arduino IDE setup
   - Detailed firmware upload instructions
   - Troubleshooting section for common issues

6. Created QC_TESTING_USER_MANUAL.txt
   - Comprehensive user manual for QC team
   - Daily workflow procedures
   - Detailed troubleshooting guide
   - Best practices section

7. Created QUICK_START_GUIDE.txt
   - One-page quick reference
   - Essential steps only
   - Easy to print and post at workstation

8. Created DEPLOYMENT_README.txt
   - Overview of deployment package
   - Quick start instructions
   - System requirements

9. Created this CHANGELOG.txt
   - Track all changes and improvements
   - Version history

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------

Firmware Changes:
- File: virc_firmware/virc_firmware.ino
- Lines removed: 129-140 (duplicate code)
- No functional changes, only bug fix
- Firmware version remains: 1.1

GUI Changes:
- File: python_test/complete_gui.py
- Lines modified: 16-20 (USB VID constants)
- Lines modified: 260-292 (refresh_devices method)
- Added dual VID support (Raspberry Pi + Adafruit)
- Backward compatible with existing devices

Python Dependencies:
- hidapi: 0.14.0 (unchanged)
- pillow: >=10.0.0 (now documented in requirements.txt)

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
------------------------
Before deployment:
□ Upload fixed firmware to test device
□ Verify device appears with correct VID (0x2e8a)
□ Test GUI application connection
□ Test CLI application (main.py)
□ Test all 6 buttons on both remote types
□ Verify export results functionality
□ Test on clean machine (no dev environment)

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
None currently.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Suggested):
--------------------------------
- Create standalone .exe with PyInstaller
- Add support for additional remote types
- Add test history database
- Add batch testing mode
- Add statistics dashboard
- Add remote control profile management
